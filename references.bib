abstract={Game Analytics has gained a tremendous amount of attention in game development and game research in recent years. The widespread adoption of data-driven business intelligence practices at operational, tactical and strategic levels in the game industry, combined with the integration of quantitative measures in user-oriented game research, has caused a paradigm shift. Historically, game development has not been data-driven, but this is changing as the benefits of adopting and adapting analytics to inform decision making across all levels of the industry are becoming generally known and accepted.},

It better fits real-world examples and connects gamification with the literature on persuasive design.",

  abstract="Learning analytics encompasses a range of cutting-edge educational technologies, methods, models, techniques, algorithms, and best practices that provide all members of an educational community with a window into what actually takes place over the trajectory of a student's learning. This chapter provides an introduction to the volume more generally, which attempts to provide an entry point into the field by showcasing the latest results, strategies, guidelines, methods, models, and tools. Collecting all of this information in one volume will allow researchers, instructors, educational administrators, and others interested in learning analytics to take stock of ongoing efforts in the field depending upon their unique institutional interests. As a field with a broad appeal, simply navigating the extant literature of learning analytics, let alone attempting to put any of those principles into practice, can prove daunting. The volume's chapters each attempt to consolidate much of the available literature while putting forth best practice guidelines or model case studies that might prove of interest to particular types of readers. As such, this book is organized not around common problems or the mounting complexity of its efforts, but rather around the kinds of communities that each chapter attempts to address.",

  abstract="``Serious Games'' is a unique industry that is concerned with the training/learning performance assessment of its clients. It is one of three digital technology industries (along with digital games, and online learning) that are rapidly advancing into the arena of analytics. The analytics from these industries all came from the tracing of user-generated data as they interacted with the systems, but differed from one another in the primary purposes for such analytics. For example, the purpose of game analytics is to support the growth of digital (entertainment) games, while that of learning analytics is to support the online learning industries. Although some game and learning analytics can indeed be used in serious games, they lack specific metrics and methods that outline the effectiveness of serious games---an important feature to stakeholders. Serious Games Analytics need to provide (actionable) insights that are of values to the stakeholders---specific strategies/policies to improve the serious games, and to (re)train or remediate play-learners for performance improvement. Since the performance metrics from one industry are unlikely to transfer well into another industry, those that are optimal for use in the Serious Games industry must be properly identified as Serious Games Analytics---to properly measure, assess, and improve performance with serious games.",

  abstract="Integrating technology into higher education curricula to extend the physical boundaries of the classroom can be of significant value, as it enables students to interact and learn outside of class time. This is particularly true in larger gateway courses, where there are fewer opportunities for students to engage in higher-order thinking and to construct their own understanding of core concepts. While the introduction of technology like blogging can create a successful learning experience, any large number of students creates additional noise that makes it harder for instructors to isolate the students most in need of help. This chapter describes an analysis method and tool that uses lexical analysis to allow an instructor to automatically track how a student's written language migrates from mere paraphrase to mastery, isolating the moment when the student's understanding of core concepts best demonstrates an ability to place that concept into his or her own words, a moment that we have chosen to call the ``Point of Originality.'' Through two case studies, higher point of originality values is shown to correspond strongly with likely student achievement.",

We first provide an overview of the emerging field of learning analytics, and then describe a learning-analytic tool which reports student use of the Lectopia lecture capture system across the weeks of a semester, both collectively and individually. Observation of the data provided by the system enabled us to develop a set of proto-theoretical categories of behaviour, with associated algorithms to numerically identify these categories. Finally, we describe the use of the learning-analytic tool in a mixed methods approach to investigate in depth how students, with different characteristics, engage with and learn from technology-enhanced learning environments. }

The main aim of learning analytics is to improve learning outcomes and the overall learning process in electronic learning virtual classrooms and computer-supported education. The most basic unit of learning data in virtual learning environments for learning analytics is the interaction, but there is no consensus yet on which interactions are relevant for effective learning. Drawing upon extant literature, this research defines three system-independent classifications of interactions and evaluates the relation of their components with academic performance across two different learning modalities: virtual learning environment (VLE) supported face-to-face (F2F) and online learning. In order to do so, we performed an empirical study with data from six online and two VLE-supported F2F courses. Data extraction and analysis required the development of an ad hoc tool based on the proposed interaction classification. The main finding from this research is that, for each classification, there is a relation between some type of interactions and academic performance in online courses, whereas this relation is non-significant in the case of VLE-supported F2F courses. Implications for theory and practice are discussed next."

The analysis combined game log data with measures of in-game performance and learners' goal orientations. The findings indicated students in the high performance and mastery-oriented groups tended to use the tools more appropriately relative to the stage they were at in the problem-solving process, and more productively than students in low performance groups. The use of data visualization with log data in combination with more traditional measures shows visualization as a promising technique in analytics with multiple data sets that can facilitate the interpretation of the relationships among data points at no cost to the complexity of the data. Design implications and future applications of serious games analytics and data visualization to the serious game are discussed.",

We developed Sortko, an Android-based smartphone application for learning sorting algorithms, an important undergraduate computer science topic. The application consists of four main components—the module for interactive sorting, the scaffolding module, the motivational module, and the graphical user interface module, each with a distinct role of helping students in learning sorting algorithms. Our research methodology included data collection with administered two surveys, collected exam results and recorded application usage data. Analysis of the collected data shows our approach is an effective way of learning sorting algorithms. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Comput Appl Eng Educ 21:E41–E50, 2013},
